## **Top Tips for Beginners to Win Big in Coin Master**

While getting free spins and coins is crucial to your success, knowing how to use them effectively will make a significant difference in your gameplay.

### **1. Save Spins for Special Events**

Many Coin Master events offer increased rewards for completing specific actions. It’s a good idea to save your spins for these events so you can maximize the rewards you earn from them.

### **2. Use Raids and Attacks Wisely**

Attacks and raids are the main ways to earn coins in Coin Master. However, it’s important to use them strategically:
- **Raid** players who have higher coin stacks.
- **Attack** villages that don’t have shields to maximize your rewards.

Using **Foxy**, the pet that boosts raid rewards, is also an excellent way to maximize the loot from your raids.

### **3. Upgrade Your Village Gradually**

As you earn coins, focus on upgrading one building at a time to avoid wasting coins. Completing a village unlocks new levels and new opportunities to earn more spins and coins.

Coin Master revolves around completing card collections. Completing sets rewards you with extra spins, coins, and other valuable prizes. You can trade duplicate cards with friends to complete sets faster.

#### **Card Collection Tips**
- Join online **Coin Master trading groups** to trade cards with other players.
- Keep an eye out for rare cards, as they often offer better rewards.
